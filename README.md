# Traveller Lookup Formula Builder

This program is designed to build excel formulas for a specific function in the Pine River Traveller.

It takes a couple of criteria points via inquirer, including row ranges, columns, and names.

It uses that criteria to build a formula that can be used in excel with the specific lookup functions we already are using manually.

In order to run the code, just launch the "traveller-formula.bat" file.
